A pedagogical codebase for operating with volpiano strings.

## Cloning

Clone as usual
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DDMAL/volpiano_toys.git
```

## Virtual environment

Working with a virtual environment is preferred.

To create the environment with `venv`, run the following:
```
python3 -m venv .env
```

Activate the environment and install the `requirements.txt`
```
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Unit tests

Run the included unit tests to make sure everything passes

```
python -m unittest
```

If you get an `OK` message at the end, everything is good.
